# Rationale

## Why Event Bus (Epic 10) Before AI (Epic 6)?

AI agents need to observe IDE events:
- `file:created` - AI knows when files are added
- `file:modified` - AI can track changes
- `terminal:output` - AI can read command results
- `sync:completed` - AI knows when sync is done

Without Event Bus, AI operates blind.

## Why Tool Facades (Epic 12) Before AI (Epic 6)?

AI tools need clean interfaces:
- AgentFileTools → wraps LocalFSAdapter + SyncManager
- AgentTerminalTools → wraps ProcessManager
- AgentSyncTools → wraps SyncManager events

These facades isolate AI from implementation details.

## Why Code Splitting (Epic 11) is Parallel?

- Doesn't block functionality
- Can be done incrementally
- Each file split is independent
- Improves maintainability, not features
```
