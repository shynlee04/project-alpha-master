# Step 2: Diagnose & Check-Up

## STEP GOAL

Perform comprehensive diagnosis: assess current state, identify needed agents/workflows, evaluate dependencies.

## EXECUTION PROTOCOLS

1. **Assess Current State**
   - Check codebase state (if applicable)
   - Review existing agents/workflows
   - Identify what already exists
   - Note current capabilities

2. **Identify Requirements**
   - What agents are needed?
   - What workflows are needed?
   - What data/context is required?
   - What dependencies exist?

3. **Evaluate Dependencies**
   - What must happen first?
   - What can run in parallel?
   - What blocks other work?
   - What's the critical path?

4. **Perform Check-Up**
   - Are prerequisites met?
   - Are resources available?
   - Are there any blockers?
   - What risks exist?

5. **Create Diagnosis Summary**
   - Write diagnosis to plan file
   - Document current state
   - List required agents/workflows
   - Note dependencies and risks

6. **Proceed to Planning**
   - Load and execute step-03-plan.md

## OUTPUTS

- Diagnosis summary in master-plan.md
- Current state assessment
- Required agents/workflows list
- Dependencies and risks identified

## SUCCESS CRITERIA

- Complete understanding of current state
- All required agents/workflows identified
- Dependencies mapped
- Ready for planning phase

## NEXT STEP

Proceed to Step 3: Create Master Plan
