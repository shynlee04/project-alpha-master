# Handoff to Dev Agent

## Story Details
- **Epic:** 23 (UX/UI Modernization)
- **Story:** 23-1 (Install TailwindCSS 4.x + Vite Plugin)
- **Status:** ready-for-dev
- **Priority:** P1
- **Platform:** B (Second Agent)

## Task
Implement Epic 23 Story 1: Install TailwindCSS 4.x + Vite Plugin

## Context Files
1. Story File: `_bmad-output/sprint-artifacts/23-1-install-tailwindcss-4.md`
2. Context XML: `_bmad-output/sprint-artifacts/23-1-install-tailwindcss-4-context.xml`
3. Sprint Status: `_bmad-output/sprint-artifacts/sprint-status.yaml`
4. Workflow Status: `_bmad-output/bmm-workflow-status.yaml`
5. Project Context: `_bmad-output/project-context.md`
6. Architecture: `_bmad-output/architecture.md`
7. UX Design: `_bmad-output/ux-design.md`

## Acceptance Criteria
From the story file:

### AC-1: TailwindCSS Installation Verification
- [x] Verify TailwindCSS 4.x is installed (v4.1.18)
- [x] Verify `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin is installed (v4.1.18)
- [x] Confirm no additional dependencies needed (postcss/autoprefixer handled by plugin)

### AC-2: Configuration Verification
- [x] Verify Vite plugin is configured in `vite.config.ts`
- [x] Confirm plugin placement is correct in plugins array
- [x] Validate cross-origin isolation headers are maintained

### AC-3: CSS Integration Setup
- [ ] Create main CSS file with Tailwind directives (@tailwind base, components, utilities)
- [ ] Import CSS file in main application entry point
- [ ] Test TailwindCSS classes work in a sample component

## Research Findings (from Context XML)
- TailwindCSS 4.x is ALREADY installed and configured in the project
- Package.json shows `tailwindcss@4.1.18` and `@tailwindcss/vite@4.1.18`
- Vite config already has `tailwindcss()` plugin configured
- Cross-origin isolation headers are maintained
- No additional dependencies needed for basic setup
- Story focus shifted to verification, CSS file creation, and testing

## Implementation Tasks
1. **T1:** Create main CSS file with @tailwind directives (`src/styles.css` or `src/index.css`)
2. **T2:** Import CSS in main application entry point (`src/routes/__root.tsx` or main entry)
3. **T3:** Test Tailwind classes in a sample component (create test component)
4. **T4:** Update story documentation with implementation details
5. **T5:** Run tests to ensure no regressions

## Technical Notes
- TailwindCSS 4.x uses Vite plugin (no separate config files needed)
- Plugin is already in `vite.config.ts` - verify it's correctly placed
- CSS file should include `@tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities;`
- Consider adding custom base styles for theming (see UX design spec)
- Test with a simple component using Tailwind classes (e.g., `bg-blue-500 text-white p-4 rounded-lg`)

## Dependencies
- tailwindcss@^4.1.18 (already installed)
- @tailwindcss/vite@^4.1.18 (already installed)
- No additional dependencies required

## Success Criteria
- TailwindCSS classes work in the application
- CSS file is properly imported and applied
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- All tests pass (`pnpm test`)
- Development server runs without errors (`pnpm dev`)

## Handoff Protocol
- Use the `@bmad-bmm-dev` mode for implementation
- Follow the story-dev-cycle workflow (Phase 3: Development)
- Execute research tasks from story file before implementation
- Update Dev Agent Record in story file with progress
- Run tests after each task
- Update sprint-status.yaml when moving to "in-progress" and "review"
- Create completion report back to BMAD Master

## Next Steps
1. Switch to Dev mode: `@bmad-bmm-dev`
2. Execute story development workflow
3. Report completion with artifacts and status updates
