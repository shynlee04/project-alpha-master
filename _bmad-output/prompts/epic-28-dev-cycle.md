## Feedback of the previous cycle:
- Where the heck is localization of both en and vi using i18n client-side translation

## Epic 28 dev-cycle notices and enhancements:
appart from acting as /bmad-core-agents-bmad-master coordinating /bmad-bmm-agents-sm and /bmad-bmm-agents-dev (sometimes /bmad-bmm-agents-ux-designer ) to iterate , validate, review using BMAD workflows and loop till 100% passed as instructed in /story-dev-cycle  with inter-connected tassks to update these 2 status files ```_bmad-output\sprint-artifacts\sprint-status.yaml
_bmad-output\bmm-workflow-status.yaml``` -> You are also expected these frontend developments that beyond best-in-class coding practices and showing professionalism but also these:

1. **Refined, non-generic design** with no AI aesthetic, inspired by MistralAI’s 8-bit gaming interfaces (reference materials provided in _bmad-output\unified_ide_workspace_ux_ui\stitch_unified_ide_workspace\*).
2. **TailwindCSS + ShadcnUI** for styling, ensuring no hard-coded styles, with full dark theme support.
3. **Client-side localization** for English and Vietnamese.
4. **Essential interfaces** for agent management, CRUD operations, and workflow interactions, as defined in [bmad-bmm-agents-ux-designer.md](http://bmad-bmm-agents-ux-designer.md/) and [bmad-bmm-workflows-create-epics-and-stories.md](http://bmad-bmm-workflows-create-epics-and-stories.md/).

- **Complete UX/UI Overhaul:** Deliver a fully upgraded and enhanced UX/UI that fixes current flaws and inefficiencies, setting a new standard for professionalism and user experience.
- **Logical Routing and Wiring:** Ensure all components are logically routed and wired, with backend mocking where necessary, using React Tanstack Start for client-side development.
- **Modern Frontend Practices:** Implement TailwindCSS and ShadcnUI with tokenized, non-hardcoded styles, ensuring reusability, consistency, and professionalism.
- **Future-Proofing:** Prepare interfaces for future roadmap phases by categorizing them in the filetree, mocking backend states with frontend hooks, and mapping accurate user flows based on real-life use cases.
- **Localization:** Implement client-side i18n for English and Vietnamese, with AI agents handling localization.
- **Visualization and Branding:** Create visuals that demonstrate clear use cases, user journeys, and future roadmap expectations to impress users and investors.
- **Documentation:** Include JSDOC comments and references to BMAD docs for backtracking and future backend integration.

**References:**

- Static HTML and images generated with Google Stitch for style and interface inspiration.
- Architecture documentation, product visions, roadmaps, and ux-specification for alignment.

**Expectations:**

- A complete upgrade of the UX/UI that impresses and fixes current flaws.
- All components logically routed, wired, and extended with modern frontend practices.
- Interfaces that are wired, routed, and logically mapped to boost user experience.
- Future-proofing with categorized filetree, mocked backend states, and accurate user flows.
- Clear demonstration of user journeys and use cases through well-articulated e2e expectations.
- Professional first impression through meticulous care for details and frontend professionalism.

Also make sure to check with sprint's status for if any tasks of the story and how other stories of the same epic 28 are connected and defined each other -> then if they make sensical integration with each other -> check the stories to other epics and their stories for any integration points needed to get wired or putting comments in codes and dev notes in artifacts and documents to show inter-connected sign posts and reminders for later stage developments (Using BMAD framework)

- Make sure to use tools like @web and MCP servers' tools wisely -> they help you make your cycles and workflows more effective. As this conversation is ongoing and will get long as for we will complete handle the epic and make good connection to AI agent foundational development which will result next after this epic.
