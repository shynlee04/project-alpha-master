- [ ] TypeScript: pnpm build passes
- [ ] Code review approved
- [ ] MCP research documented

### Browser E2E Verification:
- [ ] Manual browser test passed with screenshot/recording

## Notes

**P0 Governance Fix (2025-12-26)**:
- Status updated from "done" to "backlog" to reflect incomplete implementation
- E2E verification directory structure created
- Screenshot/recording requirement enforced
- Cannot mark story as DONE until all acceptance criteria met and E2E verified
- Story dependency enforced: MVP-2 depends on MVP-1 being DONE

**Next Steps**:
1. Complete all 7/7 acceptance criteria
2. Perform MCP research for unfamiliar patterns
3. Complete unit tests (≥80% coverage)
4. Pass TypeScript build
5. Get code review approval
6. Perform manual browser E2E verification
7. Capture screenshot/recording of working feature
8. Complete verification checklist
9. Mark story as DONE

## MCP Research Documentation

**Status**: NOT COMPLETED
**Location**: `_bmad-output/mcp-research/MVP-2-mcp-research.md`
**Required**: Before implementing unfamiliar patterns, complete 4-step MCP research protocol:
1. Context7: Query library documentation for API signatures
2. Deepwiki: Check repo wikis for architecture decisions
3. Tavily/Exa: Search for 2025 best practices
4. Repomix: Analyze current codebase structure
