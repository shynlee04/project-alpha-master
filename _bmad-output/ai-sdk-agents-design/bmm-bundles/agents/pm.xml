        1. Find the &lt;file id="bmad/core/tasks/workflow.xml"&gt; element in this document
        2. Extract the content from within the CDATA section

        Load classification data files COMPLETELY:
  
  - Load {project_types_data} - contains project type definitions, detection signals, and requirements
  - Load {domain_complexity_data} - contains domain classifications, complexity levels, and special requirements
  
  Parse CSV structure:
  
  - project_types_data has columns: project_type, detection_signals, key_questions, required_sections, skip_sections, web_search_triggers, innovation_signals
  - domain_complexity_data has columns: domain, signals, complexity, key_concerns, required_knowledge, suggested_workflow, web_searches, special_sections
  
  Store these in memory for use throughout the workflow.
      </action>
      <action>
        Begin natural discovery conversation:
  "Tell me about what you want to build - what problem does it solve and for whom?"
  
  As the user describes their product, listen for signals to classify:
  
  1. PROJECT TYPE classification
  2. DOMAIN classification
      </action>
      <action>
        DUAL DETECTION - Use CSV data to match:
  
  **Project Type Detection:**
  
  - Compare user's description against detection_signals from each row in project_types_data
  - Look for keyword matches (semicolon-separated in CSV)
  - Identify best matching project_type (api_backend, mobile_app, saas_b2b, developer_tool, cli_tool, web_app, game, desktop_app, iot_embedded, blockchain_web3)
  - If multiple matches, ask clarifying question
  - Store matched project_type value
  
  **Domain Detection:**
  
  - Compare user's description against signals from each row in domain_complexity_data
  - Match domain keywords (semicolon-separated in CSV)
  - Identify domain (healthcare, fintech, govtech, edtech, aerospace, automotive, scientific, legaltech, insuretech, energy, gaming, general)
  - Get complexity level from matched row (high/medium/low/redirect)
  - Store matched domain and complexity_level values
  
  **Special Cases from CSV:**
  
  - If project_type = "game" → Use project_types_data row to get redirect message
  - If domain = "gaming" → Use domain_complexity_data redirect action
  - If complexity = "high" → Note suggested_workflow and web_searches from domain row
      </action>
      <action>
        SPECIAL ROUTING based on detected values:
  
  **If game detected (from project_types_data):**
  "Game development requires the BMGD module (BMad Game Development) which has specialized workflows for game design."
  Exit workflow and redirect to BMGD.

      <critical>
        This step covers ALL user types - end users, admins, moderators, support, API consumers. If a human interacts with the system, there's a journey. No journey = no FRs = doesn't exist.
      </critical>
      <action>
        Identify all user types first:
  
  Before exploring journeys, ask the user:
  
  "Besides the primary user, who else interacts with this system?"
  
  Consider these common user types:
  
  - End users (primary)
  - Admins - manage users, settings, content
  - Moderators - review flagged content, enforce rules
  - Support staff - help users, investigate issues
  - API consumers - if dev tool or platform
  - Internal ops - analytics, monitoring, billing
  
  List all user types before proceeding.
      </action>
      <action>
        Create detailed narrative user journeys with personas:
  
  For each user type identified, create rich, detailed journeys following this pattern:
  
  **Journey Creation Process:**
  
  **1. Develop the Persona**
  Give them a name, context, and motivation:
  
  - **Name**: Realistic name (Maria, Marcus, Jordan, etc.)
  - **Backstory**: Who they are, what they want, why they need this
  - **Motivation**: Core problem they're trying to solve
  - **Emotional state**: How they feel about solving this problem
  
  Example: "Maria is a working parent who wants to cook healthy meals for her family but struggles with meal planning and limited evening time. She's tired of the same rotating dishes and wants inspiration that fits her schedule."
  
  **2. Map Their Complete Journey**
  Document their end-to-end experience:
  
  - **Entry point**: How they discover and access the product
  - **Key steps**: Each touchpoint in sequence (use arrows →)
  - **Critical actions**: What they do at each step
  - **Decision points**: Choices they make
  - **Success moment**: Where they achieve their goal
  - **Exit point**: How the journey concludes
  
  **3. Use This Exact Format for Each Journey:**
  
  **Journey [Number]: [Persona Name] - [Journey Theme]**
  [Persona description with backstory and motivation]
  
  - [Entry point] → [step 1] → [step 2] → [step 3] → [critical moment] → [step N] → [completion]
  
  **4. Explore Journey Details Conversationally**
  For each journey, ask:
  
  - "What happens at each step specifically?"
  - "What could go wrong here? What's the recovery path?"
  - "What information do they need to see/hear?"
  - "What's their emotional state at each point?"
  - "Where does this journey succeed or fail?"
  
  **5. Connect Journeys to Requirements**
  After each journey, explicitly state:
  "This journey reveals requirements for:"
  
  - List specific capability areas (e.g., onboarding, meal planning, admin dashboard)
  - Help user see how different journeys create different feature sets
  
  **Example Output Structure:**
  
  **Journey 1: Maria - First Recipe Discovery**
  Maria is a working parent who wants to cook healthy meals for her family but struggles with meal planning...
  
  - Discovers via search → lands on recipe page → signs up → completes preferences → browses recommendations → saves first recipe → adds to meal plan
  
  **Journey 2: [Persona] - [Theme]**
  [Persona description with context]
  
  - [Step sequence] → [critical moment] → [completion]
  
  **Journey 3: [Admin/Support Persona] - [Admin Theme]**
  [Admin persona description]
  
  - [Admin workflow] → [decision point] → [system outcome]
      </action>
      <action>
        Guide journey exploration to cover all key areas:
  
  **Aim for 3-4 journeys minimum:**
  
  1. Primary user - happy path (core experience)
  2. Primary user - edge case (different goal, error recovery)
  3. Secondary user (admin, moderator, support, etc.)
  4. API consumer (if applicable)
  
  **Ask after each:** "Another journey? We should cover [suggest uncovered user type]"
  
  **Use journeys to reveal requirements:**
  Each journey reveals different capabilities needed:
  
  - Admin journey → admin dashboard, user management
  - Support journey → ticket system, user lookup tools
  - API journey → documentation, rate limiting, keys
  - Error recovery → retry mechanisms, help content

      Example CSV row for api_backend:
  key_questions = "Endpoints needed?;Authentication method?;Data formats?;Rate limits?;Versioning?;SDK needed?"
  required_sections = "endpoint_specs;auth_model;data_schemas;error_codes;rate_limits;api_docs"
  skip_sections = "ux_ui;visual_design;user_journeys"
  
  The LLM should parse these and generate corresponding template outputs dynamically.
  
  **Template Variable Strategy:**
  The prd-template.md has common template variables defined (endpoint_specification, authentication_model, platform_requirements, device_features, tenant_model, permission_matrix).
  
  For required_sections that match these common variables:
  
  - Generate the specific template-output (e.g., endpoint_specs → endpoint_specification)
  - These will render in their own subsections in the template
  
  For required_sections that DON'T have matching template variables:
  
  - Include the content in the main project_type_requirements variable
  - This ensures all requirements are captured even if template doesn't have dedicated sections
  
  This hybrid approach balances template structure with CSV-driven flexibility.

  ✅ Each FR is implementation-agnostic (could be built many ways)
  ✅ Each FR specifies WHO and WHAT, not HOW
  ✅ No UI details, no performance numbers, no technology choices
  ✅ Comprehensive coverage of capability areas
  
  **How They Will Be Used:**
  
  1. UX Designer reads FRs → designs interactions for each capability
  2. Architect reads FRs → designs systems to support each capability
  3. PM reads FRs → creates epics and stories to implement each capability
  
  **Critical Property - COMPLETENESS:**
  Every capability discussed in vision, scope, domain requirements, and project-specific
  sections MUST be represented as an FR. Missing FRs = missing capabilities.
  
  **Critical Property - ALTITUDE:**
  FRs state WHAT capability exists and WHO it serves, NOT HOW it's implemented or
  specific UI/UX details. Those come later from UX and Architecture.
    </action>
    <action>
      Transform everything discovered into comprehensive functional requirements:
  
  **Organization - Group by CAPABILITY AREA:**
  Don't organize by technology or layer. Group by what users/system can DO:
  
  - ✅ "User Management" (not "Authentication System")
  - ✅ "Content Discovery" (not "Search Algorithm")
  - ✅ "Team Collaboration" (not "WebSocket Infrastructure")
  
  **Format - Flat, Numbered List:**
  Each FR is one clear capability statement:
  
  - FR#: [Actor] can [capability] [context/constraint if needed]
  - Number sequentially (FR1, FR2, FR3...)
  - Aim for 20-50 FRs for typical projects (fewer for simple, more for complex)
  
  **Altitude Check:**
  Each FR should answer "WHAT capability exists?" NOT "HOW is it implemented?"
  
  - ✅ "Users can customize appearance settings"
  - ❌ "Users can toggle light/dark theme with 3 font size options stored in LocalStorage"
  
  The second example belongs in Epic Breakdown, not PRD.
    </action>
    <example>
      **Well-written FRs at the correct altitude:**
  
  **User Account & Access:**
  
  - FR1: Users can create accounts with email or social authentication
  - FR2: Users can log in securely and maintain sessions across devices
  - FR3: Users can reset passwords via email verification
  - ...
  
  **Data Ownership (local-first products):**
  
  - FR10: All user data stored locally on user's device
  - FR11: Users can export complete data at any time
  - ...
  
  **Collaboration:**
  
  - FR14: Users can share content with specific users or teams
  - FR15: Users can comment on shared content
  - ...
    </example>
    <action>
      Generate the complete FR list by systematically extracting capabilities from all discussed so far for all that is in scope.
  
  Organize FRs by logical capability groups (5-8 groups typically).
  Number sequentially across all groups (FR1, FR2... FR47).
    </action>
    <action>
      SELF-VALIDATION - Before finalizing, ask yourself:
  
  **Completeness Check:**
  
  1. "Did I cover EVERY capability mentioned in the MVP scope section?"
  2. "Did I include domain-specific requirements as FRs?"
  3. "Did I cover the project-type specific needs (API/Mobile/SaaS/etc)?"
  4. "Could a UX designer read ONLY the FRs and know what to design?"
  5. "Could an Architect read ONLY the FRs and know what to support?"
  6. "Are there any user actions or system behaviors we discussed that have no FR?"
  
  **Altitude Check:**
  
  1. "Am I stating capabilities (WHAT) or implementation (HOW)?"
  2. "Am I listing acceptance criteria or UI specifics?" (Remove if yes)
  3. "Could this FR be implemented 5 different ways?" (Good - means it's not prescriptive)
  
  **Quality Check:**
  
  1. "Is each FR clear enough that someone could test whether it exists?"
  2. "Is each FR independent (not dependent on reading other FRs to understand)?"
  3. "Did I avoid vague terms like 'good', 'fast', 'easy'?" (Use NFRs for quality attributes)
  
  COMPLETENESS GATE: Review your FR list against the entire PRD written so far and think hard - did you miss anything? Add it now before proceeding.

      Announce that the PRD is complete and the unused sections will be cleaned up from the output document!
    </action>
    <action>
      CRITICAL: Clean up the PRD document before validation:
  
  Before running validation, you MUST remove any empty sections from the generated PRD:
  
  1. **Scan for empty sections** - Look for sections with no meaningful content (just whitespace or placeholder text)
  2. **Remove entire empty sections** - Delete the section header and any empty content
  3. **Keep relevant sections only** - If a project type doesn't need certain sections (e.g., API specs for a mobile app), remove those sections entirely
  4. **Ensure document flows logically** - The final PRD should only contain sections with actual content
  
  **This cleanup step is essential because:**
  
  - The template includes all possible sections for maximum flexibility
  - Not all sections apply to every project type
  - Empty sections make the PRD look incomplete and unprofessional
  - Validation expects meaningful content in all included sections
  
  **Example:** If building a CLI tool, you'd typically remove: API Specification, Platform Support, Device Capabilities, Multi-Tenancy Architecture, User Experience Principles sections.

  - Look for "create-epics-and-stories-after-ux" as optional

  2. `workflow create-architecture` - Technical architecture
  3. `workflow create-epics-and-stories` - Epic breakdown
  
  **Note:** Epics can be created at any point but have richer detail when created after UX/Architecture.

        <![CDATA[# PRD + Epics + Stories Validation Checklist
  
  **Purpose**: Comprehensive validation that PRD, epics, and stories form a complete, implementable product plan.
  
  **Scope**: Validates the complete planning output (PRD.md + epics.md) for Levels 2-4 software projects
  
  **Expected Outputs**:
  
  - PRD.md with complete requirements
  - epics.md with detailed epic and story breakdown
  - Updated bmm-workflow-status.yaml

  - [ ] Language is clear, specific, and measurable
  - [ ] Project type correctly identified and sections match
  - [ ] Domain complexity appropriately addressed
  
  ---
  
  ## 2. Functional Requirements Quality
  
  ### FR Format and Structure
  
  - [ ] Each FR has unique identifier (FR-001, FR-002, etc.)
  - [ ] FRs describe WHAT capabilities, not HOW to implement
  - [ ] FRs are specific and measurable
  - [ ] FRs are testable and verifiable
  - [ ] FRs focus on user/business value
  - [ ] No technical implementation details in FRs (those belong in architecture)
  
  ### FR Completeness
  
  - [ ] All MVP scope features have corresponding FRs
  - [ ] Growth features documented (even if deferred)
  - [ ] Vision features captured for future reference
  - [ ] Domain-mandated requirements included
  - [ ] Innovation requirements captured with validation needs
  - [ ] Project-type specific requirements complete
  
  ### FR Organization
  
  - [ ] FRs organized by capability/feature area (not by tech stack)
  - [ ] Related FRs grouped logically
  - [ ] Dependencies between FRs noted when critical
  - [ ] Priority/phase indicated (MVP vs Growth vs Vision)
  
  ---
  
  ## 3. Epics Document Completeness
  
  ### Required Files
  
  - [ ] epics.md exists in output folder
  - [ ] Epic list in PRD.md matches epics in epics.md (titles and count)
  - [ ] All epics have detailed breakdown sections
  
  ### Epic Quality
  
  - [ ] Each epic has clear goal and value proposition
  - [ ] Each epic includes complete story breakdown
  - [ ] Stories follow proper user story format: "As a [role], I want [goal], so that [benefit]"
  - [ ] Each story has numbered acceptance criteria
  - [ ] Prerequisites/dependencies explicitly stated per story
  - [ ] Stories are AI-agent sized (completable in 2-4 hour session)
  
  ---
  
  ## 4. FR Coverage Validation (CRITICAL)
  
  ### Complete Traceability
  
  - [ ] **Every FR from PRD.md is covered by at least one story in epics.md**
  - [ ] Each story references relevant FR numbers
  - [ ] No orphaned FRs (requirements without stories)
  - [ ] No orphaned stories (stories without FR connection)
  - [ ] Coverage matrix verified (can trace FR → Epic → Stories)
  
  ### Coverage Quality
  
  - [ ] Stories sufficiently decompose FRs into implementable units
  - [ ] Complex FRs broken into multiple stories appropriately
  - [ ] Simple FRs have appropriately scoped single stories
  - [ ] Non-functional requirements reflected in story acceptance criteria
  - [ ] Domain requirements embedded in relevant stories
  
  ---
  
  ## 5. Story Sequencing Validation (CRITICAL)
  
  ### Epic 1 Foundation Check
  
  - [ ] **Epic 1 establishes foundational infrastructure**
  - [ ] Epic 1 delivers initial deployable functionality
  - [ ] Epic 1 creates baseline for subsequent epics
  - [ ] Exception: If adding to existing app, foundation requirement adapted appropriately
  
  ### Vertical Slicing
  
  - [ ] **Each story delivers complete, testable functionality** (not horizontal layers)
  - [ ] No "build database" or "create UI" stories in isolation
  - [ ] Stories integrate across stack (data + logic + presentation when applicable)
  - [ ] Each story leaves system in working/deployable state
  
  ### No Forward Dependencies
  
  - [ ] **No story depends on work from a LATER story or epic**
  - [ ] Stories within each epic are sequentially ordered
  - [ ] Each story builds only on previous work
  - [ ] Dependencies flow backward only (can reference earlier stories)
  - [ ] Parallel tracks clearly indicated if stories are independent
  
  ### Value Delivery Path
  
  - [ ] Each epic delivers significant end-to-end value
  - [ ] Epic sequence shows logical product evolution
  - [ ] User can see value after each epic completion
  - [ ] MVP scope clearly achieved by end of designated epics
  
  ---
  
  ## 6. Scope Management
  
  ### MVP Discipline
  
  - [ ] MVP scope is genuinely minimal and viable
  - [ ] Core features list contains only true must-haves
  - [ ] Each MVP feature has clear rationale for inclusion
  - [ ] No obvious scope creep in "must-have" list
  
  ### Future Work Captured
  
  - [ ] Growth features documented for post-MVP
  - [ ] Vision features captured to maintain long-term direction
  - [ ] Out-of-scope items explicitly listed
  - [ ] Deferred features have clear reasoning for deferral
  
  ### Clear Boundaries
  
  - [ ] Stories marked as MVP vs Growth vs Vision
  - [ ] Epic sequencing aligns with MVP → Growth progression
  - [ ] No confusion about what's in vs out of initial scope
  
  ---
  
  ## 7. Research and Context Integration
  
  ### Source Document Integration
  
  - [ ] **If product brief exists:** Key insights incorporated into PRD
  - [ ] **If domain brief exists:** Domain requirements reflected in FRs and stories
  - [ ] **If research documents exist:** Research findings inform requirements
  - [ ] **If competitive analysis exists:** Differentiation strategy clear in PRD
  - [ ] All source documents referenced in PRD References section
  
  ### Research Continuity to Architecture
  
  - [ ] Domain complexity considerations documented for architects
  - [ ] Technical constraints from research captured
  - [ ] Regulatory/compliance requirements clearly stated
  - [ ] Integration requirements with existing systems documented
  - [ ] Performance/scale requirements informed by research data
  
  ### Information Completeness for Next Phase
  
  - [ ] PRD provides sufficient context for architecture decisions
  - [ ] Epics provide sufficient detail for technical design
  - [ ] Stories have enough acceptance criteria for implementation
  - [ ] Non-obvious business rules documented
  - [ ] Edge cases and special scenarios captured
  
  ---
  
  ## 8. Cross-Document Consistency
  
  ### Terminology Consistency
  
  - [ ] Same terms used across PRD and epics for concepts

  - [ ] Cross-references accurate (FR numbers, section references)
  - [ ] Formatting consistent throughout
  - [ ] Tables/lists formatted properly
  
  ### Completeness Indicators

  ## Critical Failures (Auto-Fail)
  
  If ANY of these are true, validation FAILS:
  
  - [ ] ❌ **No epics.md file exists** (two-file output required)
  - [ ] ❌ **Epic 1 doesn't establish foundation** (violates core sequencing principle)
  - [ ] ❌ **Stories have forward dependencies** (breaks sequential implementation)
  - [ ] ❌ **Stories not vertically sliced** (horizontal layers block value delivery)
  - [ ] ❌ **Epics don't cover all FRs** (orphaned requirements)
  - [ ] ❌ **FRs contain technical implementation details** (should be in architecture)
  - [ ] ❌ **No FR traceability to stories** (can't validate coverage)
  - [ ] ❌ **Template variables unfilled** (incomplete document)
  
  ---
  
  ## Validation Summary
  
  - **Pass Rate ≥ 95%:** ✅ EXCELLENT - Ready for architecture phase
  - **Pass Rate 85-94%:** ⚠️ GOOD - Minor fixes needed
  - **Pass Rate 70-84%:** ⚠️ FAIR - Important issues to address
  - **Pass Rate < 70%:** ❌ POOR - Significant rework required
  
  ### Critical Issue Threshold
  
  - **0 Critical Failures:** Proceed to fixes
  - **1+ Critical Failures:** STOP - Must fix critical issues first
  
  ---
  
  ## Validation Execution Notes
  
  **When validating:**
  
  1. **Load ALL documents - whole or sharded (but not both of each) for example epics.md vs epics/\*.md:**
     - PRD.md (required)
     - epics.md (required)
     - product-brief.md (if exists)
     - domain-brief.md (if exists)
     - research documents (if referenced)
  
  2. **Validate in order:**
     - Check critical failures first (immediate stop if any found)
     - Verify PRD completeness
     - Verify epics completeness
     - Cross-reference FR coverage (most important)
     - Check sequencing (second most important)
     - Validate research integration
     - Check polish and quality
  
  3. **Report findings:**
     - List critical failures prominently
     - Group issues by severity
     - Provide specific line numbers/sections
     - Suggest concrete fixes
     - Highlight what's working well
  
  4. **Provide actionable next steps:**
     - If validation passes: "Ready for architecture workflow"
     - If minor issues: "Fix [X] items then re-validate"
     - If major issues: "Rework [sections] then re-validate"
     - If critical failures: "Must fix critical items before proceeding"
  
  ---
  
  **Remember:** This validation ensures the entire planning phase is complete and the implementation phase has everything needed to succeed. Be thorough but fair - the goal is quality, not perfection.

                  <action>
                    Now that you have ALL available context (PRD + Architecture + UX), design epics that deliver incremental user value while leveraging the technical design decisions.
  
  **EPIC DESIGN PRINCIPLES:**
  
  1. **User-Value First**: Each epic must enable users to accomplish something meaningful
  2. **Leverage Architecture**: Build upon the technical decisions already made
  3. **Incremental Delivery**: Each epic should be independently valuable
  4. **Logical Dependencies**: Dependencies should flow naturally, not artificially
  
  **USE YOUR FULL CONTEXT:**
  
  From PRD: Group related functional requirements that deliver user outcomes
  From Architecture: Respect technical boundaries and integration points
  From UX: Design around user journeys and interaction flows
  
  **VALID EPIC EXAMPLES:**
  
  ✅ **CORRECT - User Value with Technical Context:**
  
  - Epic 1: Foundation Setup (infrastructure, deployment, core services)
  - Epic 2: User Authentication & Profile Management (register, login, profile management)
  - Epic 3: Content Creation & Management (create, edit, publish, organize content)
  - Epic 4: Content Discovery & Interaction (browse, search, share, comment)
  
  ❌ **WRONG - Technical Layer Breakdown:**
  
  - Epic 1: Database Schema & Models
  - Epic 2: REST API Endpoints
  - Epic 3: Frontend Components
  - Epic 4: Authentication Service
  
  **PRESENT YOUR EPIC STRUCTURE:**
  
  For each proposed epic, provide:
  
  - **Epic Title**: Value-based, not technical
  - **User Value Statement**: What users can accomplish after this epic
  - **PRD Coverage**: Which FRs this epic addresses
  - **Technical Context**: How this leverages Architecture decisions
  - **UX Integration**: How this incorporates user experience patterns (if available)
  - **Dependencies**: What must come before (natural dependencies only)
  
  **FOUNDATION EPIC GUIDELINES:**
  
  For Epic 1, include technical foundation based on Architecture:
  
  - Project setup and build system
  - Core infrastructure and deployment pipeline
  - Database schema setup
  - Basic authentication foundation
  - API framework setup
  
  This enables all subsequent user-facing epics.
                  </action>
                  <template-output>
                    epics_structure_plan

                    epics_technical_context
                  </template-output>
                </step>
                <step n="2" goal="Create detailed stories with complete implementation context" repeat="for-each-epic">
                  <action>**EPIC {{N}} - COMPREHENSIVE STORY CREATION:**</action>
                  <action>
                    For Epic {{N}}: {{epic_title}}, create bite-sized stories that incorporate ALL available context.
  
  **STORY CREATION WITH FULL CONTEXT:**
  
  For each story, you now have the complete picture:
  
  - **WHAT to build** (from PRD FRs)
  - **HOW to build it** (from Architecture decisions)
  - **HOW users interact** (from UX patterns, if available)
  
  **TRANSFORM STRATEGIC REQUIREMENTS INTO TACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION:**
  
  PRD says: "Users can create accounts"
  Architecture says: "Use PostgreSQL with bcrypt hashing, JWT tokens, rate limiting"
  UX says: "Modal dialog with email/password fields, real-time validation, loading states"
  
  Your story becomes: Specific implementation details with exact acceptance criteria
  
  **STORY PATTERN FOR EACH EPIC {{N}}:**
  
  **Epic Goal:** {{epic_goal}}
  
  For each story M in Epic {{N}}:
  
  - **User Story**: As a [user type], I want [specific capability], So that [value/benefit]
  - **Acceptance Criteria**: BDD format with COMPLETE implementation details
  - **Technical Implementation**: Specific guidance from Architecture
  - **User Experience**: Exact interaction patterns from UX (if available)
  - **Prerequisites**: Only previous stories, never forward dependencies
  
  **DETAILED ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA GUIDELINES:**
  
  Include ALL implementation specifics:
  
  **From Architecture:**
  
  - Exact API endpoints and contracts
  - Database operations and validations
  - Authentication/authorization requirements
  - Error handling patterns
  - Performance requirements
  - Security considerations
  - Integration points with other systems
  
  **From UX (if available):**
  
  - Specific screen/page references
  - Interaction patterns and behaviors
  - Form validation rules and error messages
  - Responsive behavior
  - Accessibility requirements
  - Loading states and transitions
  - Success/error feedback patterns
  
  **From PRD:**
  
  - Business rules and constraints
  - User types and permissions
  - Compliance requirements
  - Success criteria
  
  **STORY SIZING PRINCIPLE:**
  
  Each story must be completable by a single dev agent in one focused session. If a story becomes too large, break it down further while maintaining user value.
  
  **EXAMPLE RICH STORY:**
  
  **Story:** User Registration with Email Verification
  
  As a new user, I want to create an account using my email address, So that I can access the platform's features.
  
  **Acceptance Criteria:**
  Given I am on the landing page
  When I click the "Sign Up" button
  Then the registration modal opens (UX Mockup 3.2)
  
  And I see email and password fields with proper labels
  And the email field validates RFC 5322 format in real-time
  And the password field shows strength meter (red→yellow→green)
  And I see "Password must be 8+ chars with 1 uppercase, 1 number, 1 special"
  
  When I submit valid registration data
  Then POST /api/v1/auth/register is called (Architecture section 4.1)
  And the user record is created in users table with bcrypt hash (Architecture 6.2)
  And a verification email is sent via SendGrid (Architecture 7.3)
  And I see "Check your email for verification link" message
  And I cannot log in until email is verified
  
  **Technical Notes:**
  
  - Use PostgreSQL users table (Architecture section 6.2)
  - Implement rate limiting: 3 attempts per hour per IP (Architecture 8.1)
  - Return JWT token on successful verification (Architecture 5.2)
  - Log registration events to audit_events table (Architecture 9.4)
  - Form validation follows UX Design patterns (UX section 4.1)

                    Review the complete epic and story breakdown for quality and completeness using ALL available context.
  
  **FR COVERAGE VALIDATION:**
  
  Create complete FR Coverage Matrix showing every PRD functional requirement mapped to specific stories:
  
  - **FR1:** [description] → Epic X, Story X.Y (with implementation details)
  - **FR2:** [description] → Epic Y, Story Y.A (with implementation details)
  - **FR3:** [description] → Epic Z, Story Z.B (with implementation details)
  - ...
  
  **CRITICAL VALIDATION:** Every single FR from the PRD must be covered by at least one story with complete acceptance criteria.
  
  **ARCHITECTURE INTEGRATION VALIDATION:**
  
  Verify that Architecture decisions are properly implemented:
  
  - All API endpoints from Architecture are covered in stories
  - Data models from Architecture are properly created and populated
  - Authentication/authorization patterns are consistently applied
  - Performance requirements are addressed in relevant stories
  - Security measures are implemented where required
  - Error handling follows Architecture patterns
  - Integration points between systems are properly handled
  
  **UX INTEGRATION VALIDATION** {{if ux_design_content}}:
  
  Verify that UX design patterns are properly implemented:
  
  - User flows follow the designed journey
  - Screen layouts and components match specifications
  - Interaction patterns work as designed
  - Responsive behavior matches breakpoints
  - Accessibility requirements are met
  - Error states and feedback patterns are implemented
  - Form validation follows UX guidelines
  - Loading states and transitions are implemented
    {{/if}}
  
  **STORY QUALITY VALIDATION:**
  
  - All stories are sized for single dev agent completion
  - Acceptance criteria are specific and testable
  - Technical implementation guidance is clear
  - User experience details are incorporated
  - No forward dependencies exist
  - Epic sequence delivers incremental value
  - Foundation epic properly enables subsequent work
  
  **FINAL QUALITY CHECK:**
  
  Answer these critical questions:
  
  1. **User Value:** Does each epic deliver something users can actually do/use?
  2. **Completeness:** Are ALL PRD functional requirements covered?
  3. **Technical Soundness:** Do stories properly implement Architecture decisions?
  4. **User Experience:** {{if ux_design_content}} Do stories follow UX design patterns? {{/if}}
  5. **Implementation Ready:** Can dev agents implement these stories autonomously?
