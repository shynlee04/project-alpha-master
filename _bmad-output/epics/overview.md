# Overview

This document provides the complete epic and story breakdown for Via-Gent's **Foundational Architectural Slice (Project Alpha)**, decomposing the requirements from the PRD, Architecture, and UX Design into implementable stories.

**Implementation Root (Non-Negotiable):** All Project Alpha Epic 3/4 implementation work must be made under `spikes/project-alpha/` (e.g. `spikes/project-alpha/src/...`). The repository root `src/` is a separate codebase and must not be used to fulfill Project Alpha Epic 3/4 stories.

**Project Goal:** Prove or falsify the viability of a fully client-side, AI-powered IDE that can execute tools, write files to WebContainers, sync to local disk via File System Access API, commit via isomorphic-git, and persist state to IndexedDB.
