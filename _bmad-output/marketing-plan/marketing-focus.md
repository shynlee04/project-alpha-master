Here are focused marketing/PR angles and assets tailored for Vietnamese investors, educators, and developers, leveraging the mission/roadmap/tech-stack context:

### Positioning Angles
- **Privacy-first, zero-server IDE:** 100% client-side, BYOK; code never leaves the browser—ideal for regulated corp/edu environments.
- **Agents that execute, not just suggest:** File/terminal/git actions in-browser; live previews; multi-agent roles (Orchestrator/Planner/Coder/Validator).
- **Instant classroom-ready:** Zero setup for bootcamps; works on shared machines; bilingual EN/VI.
- **Vertical-slice productivity:** From idea → plan → code → test in one tab; guardrails (DoD, MCP research protocol) to reduce hallucinations.
- **Local control, vendor choice:** Gemini/OpenAI/etc. via adapters; cost control for orgs and schools.
- **Eventual extensibility:** Roadmap to Git, dashboards, workflow visual editor, multi-agent orchestration.

### Audience-Specific Narratives
- **Vietnamese investors / enterprise IT:** Privacy-first, no SaaS lock-in, BYOK compliance; offline-capable after load; traceable research/testing governance (MCP protocol, E2E gates).
- **Education (bootcamps, universities, STEM high schools):** “No-setup labs in a browser”; EN/VI UI; instructors reclaim time lost to installs; reproducible workshops.
- **Developers/maker community:** “Spin up, code, preview in minutes”; local FS sync; WebContainers magic; agent tools with transparent actions.

### Content & Channels
- **Blog series (“From Zero to Shipping in the Browser”):**
  1) How WebContainers + File System Access enable local-like speed.  
  2) Agents that execute: diff previews, approvals, terminal actions.  
  3) BYOK & cost control for teams.  
  4) Teaching with zero-setup labs (case: workshop template).  
  5) Roadmap deep-dive: Agent dashboard, workflow visual editor.
- **Infographics (for LinkedIn/FB/Zalo):**
  - “Why 100% client-side?” (privacy, speed, cost)  
  - “AI that operates vs. suggests” (tool call flow)  
  - “Zero-setup classroom” (student/instructor journey)
- **Short video demos (YouTube/LinkedIn/TikTok):**
  - 90s: open folder, run pnpm dev in-browser, live preview.  
  - 90s: agent writes code + terminal output + diff approval.  
  - 60s: instructor opens class repo, all students follow instantly.
- **Community touchpoints:**
  - Vietnamese dev groups (Facebook, Zalo), Google Developer Groups, Viet AI, university CS clubs.  
  - Guest talks/webinars: “Building AI-first IDEs without servers.”  
  - Hackathon starter kits: prebuilt templates + agent configs.
- **PR hooks:**
  - “No servers, no lock-in: AI IDE runs entirely in your browser.”  
  - “Teach coding in 5 minutes: classrooms without installs.”  
  - “Agents that ship code, not just suggest it.”

### Landing/Marketing Page Ideas
- **Hero:** “AI IDE that runs entirely in your browser—no servers, no lock-in.” CTA: “Try in-browser demo.”  
- **Proof strip:** Privacy-first, BYOK, EN/VI, offline after load.  
- **Use-case tiles:** (1) Solo devs/freelancers (fast onboarding), (2) Teams (multi-agent workflows), (3) Education (no-setup labs).  
- **How it works:** 3 steps—Pick folder → Start dev server → Ask agent to build.  
- **Governance & trust:** MCP research protocol, DoD with E2E gates, auditability of agent actions.  
- **Roadmap highlights:** Agent dashboard, workflow visual editor, Git suite.

### Artifacts to produce next
1) **Infographic set (VN/EN):** privacy-first, agents-execute, zero-setup classroom.  
2) **Blog post #1:** “Why 100% client-side AI IDE beats cloud IDEs for privacy and speed.”  
3) **Short demo video:** 90s build-and-run in browser + agent diff approval.  
4) **Edu one-pager:** For bootcamps/universities (EN/VI), with instructor flow and pricing model (BYOK).  
5) **Channel plan:** FB/Zalo dev groups, LinkedIn, GDG/VietAI meetups; cadence for 4-week drip.

### Suggested next steps (execution)
- Pick one hero use case per audience (investor, edu, dev) and craft one-page narrative each.  
- Create the infographic + 90s demo video first (high ROI for awareness).  
- Publish Blog #1, share to VN dev groups and LinkedIn with localized captions.  
- Prepare webinar outline: “Build and teach with a serverless AI IDE (EN/VI).”

If you want, I can draft the first blog post outline plus a social post (VN/EN) and a one-slide infographic brief.
