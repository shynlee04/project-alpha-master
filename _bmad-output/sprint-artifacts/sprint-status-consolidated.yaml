# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic not yet started
#   - in-progress: Epic actively being worked on
#   - done: All stories in epic completed
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - ready-for-dev: Story file created, ready for development
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Implementation complete, ready for review
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - done: Retrospective has been completed
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Mark epic as 'in-progress' when starting work on its first story
# - SM typically creates next story ONLY after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', then Dev runs code-review (fresh context, ideally different LLM)
# - MANDATORY: Browser E2E verification required before marking DONE (INC-2025-12-24-001)

      notes: |
        Implemented hub-based navigation system with vision-aligned onboarding.
        Created 6 core components: HubSidebar, TopicCard, TopicPortalCard, HubHomePage, NavigationBreadcrumbs, HubLayout.
        Created hub-store for state management with localStorage persistence.
        Updated translation files with English and Vietnamese translations.
        All components use 8-bit design system tokens and CVA patterns.
        TypeScript compilation passes, translation extraction passes.
        Pre-existing test failures are unrelated to hub implementation.
        Ready for browser E2E verification.

  # CRITICAL INCIDENT REMEDIATION
  # =============================================================================
  incident_remediation:
    id: "INC-2025-12-24-001"
    status: "IN_PROGRESS"
    root_cause: "Component-centric validation without E2E testing"
    remediation: |
      1. Created consolidated MVP epic for vertical slice
      2. Added mandatory browser E2E verification gates
      3. All stories require screenshot/recording proof
      4. Definition of Done updated to prevent recurrence
      5. Traceability maintained to original stories
    lessons_learned: |
      - Integration testing is mandatory
      - Component completion ≠ feature completion
      - Always validate end-to-end workflows
      - Browser verification is non-negotiable
