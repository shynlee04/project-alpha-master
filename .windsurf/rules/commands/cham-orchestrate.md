# CHAM Orchestrate

Use Master Orchestrator to understand natural language requests and create sequential execution plans.

## Usage

```
cham-orchestrate [your natural language request]
```

## Example

```
cham-orchestrate I need to refactor authentication to use JWT tokens, update the API and frontend, add tests, and update documentation.
```

## Process

1. Master Orchestrator understands your request
2. Performs diagnosis and check-up
3. Creates master plan with cycles
4. Generates executable prompts
5. You execute cycles sequentially with automatic handoffs

## Integration

- Agent: cham-master-orchestrator
- Workflow: .windsurf/workflows/cham/master-orchestration.md
